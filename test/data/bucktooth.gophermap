Welcome to Floodgap Systems' official gopher server.
Floodgap has served the gopher community since 1999
(formerly gopher.ptloma.edu). ** OVER A DECADE OF SERVICE! **

We run Bucktooth 0.2.8 on xinetd as our server system.
gopher.floodgap.com is an IBM Power 520 Express with a 2-way
4.2GHz POWER6 CPU and 8GB of RAM, running AIX 6.1 TL6.
Send gopher@floodgap.com your questions and suggestions.

THIS IS A NEW SERVER -- bugs are to be expected.
E-mail weird behaviour to us. 4/2011
